\section*{Summary}

The goal of this lab is to use what we have learned in previous labs to create a guessing game. In order to do this, I first have to create a debounce circuit. A debounce ensures that the value of the input is held for a certain period of time. In this lab we were given the debounce module and the test, so I ran the test just to make sure that I recieved the correct output. In the game, there are two different settings: a fast setting and a slow setting. In order to implement this, I created two seperate counters. Both were very similar, but they have different paramters to distinguish between fast and slow. The larger the parameter the slower the counter so I set my parameter in the fast counter to N = 24 and the slow counter to N = 26. Then  created a mux so that you can choose which setting you ant to play using switch 0. Next, I created a decoder so that the board would display on the upper four segments of the first 7-segment display digit. Lastly I created the guessFSM module which was the guessing game itself. This modules cycles through different states that correspond to different buttons being pressed. If the correct button is pressed at the correct time, you will go to the in state, and if any other button is pressed then you will go to the lose state. Also, if you reached the win state, all of the LED's will light up and if you enter the lose state, then only the first LED will light up. After this module was built, I created a testbench to test it. Then I created my overall guessing game module that put all of theses pieces together. I then created a guessing game testbench. Once it was successful I was able to play my game.


\section*{Q\&A}

(a) At what time in the simulation did the debounce circuit reach each of the four states (zero, wait1, one, wait0)? \newline
The simulation starts out in state zero and then reaches wait1 at 200.0ns, then reaches one at about 245.121ns, then reaches wait0 at 600.0ns, and then reaches state zero again at about 646.327ns. \newline 

(b) Why can this game not be implemented with regular sequential logic? \newline
 We can't use regular sequential logic because this game does not have a regular/repeating pattern. In this game, I am using a finite state machine (FSM) which handles irregular, non-repeating conditions. The pattern is non-repeating because we don't know what buttons the user is going to guess and we don't know when they are going to win or lose. They could win twice in a row, then lose one, or lose three times in a row, etc. It is an irregular pattern which means we can't use regular sequential logic. \newline

(c) What type of outputs did you use for your design (Mealy or Moore)? Explain \newline
 For my design, I used Moore because it's a much safer design than Mealy. Mealy is a machine whose ouputs are determined by both its current state and the current inputs. Whereas a Moore machine whose output are only determined by its current state. In a Moore, the outputs only change when the state changes which means that it is synchronized with the clock. In a Mealy, the ouput can change from other inputs as well which means its no longer synchronized with the clock and could cause a glitch. I created a case statement that is only based on the specific states which means that its not based on any other input so it is a Moore machine.
